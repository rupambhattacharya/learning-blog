## Stack

LIFO Eg : Browserâ€™s back button

stack.push() - insert url
stack.pop () - get url

Functions - push, pop (moving top element of stack), peek (displaying top element of stack), length(determine how many elements are in a stack)

In Javascript, array object has already functions of stack.

## Sets

No duplicate items, no order. Used to check presence of an item

collection.splice is used to remove an element

ES6 Set implementation - values, add, delete method. size is a property

Union of two sets, Interaction of two sets, Difference of two sets, Subset of set are not supported.

Add method in ES6 will return the full set.

## Queue

FIFO, buying something at grocery store cash counter, printing documents
We can use helper functions like enqueue to insert items into the queue (array.push) and dequeue (array.shift) to delete items from the queue. 

In the priority queue, you pass elements along with priority. Elements with higher priority get pushed to the beginning of the queue. 

collection.splice() helps to change the content of your array by removing or replacing existing elements with new ones, returns the array.

collection.shift() is an inbuilt Array method that removes the first element from an array and returns the removed element.
