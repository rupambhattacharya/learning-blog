## Protoype based programming vs Class based OOP
The style of OOP where there is no difference between class and objects is prototype based programming. Every object can be individual. It contains both its methods and data at the same time. Usually, we can add new properties and methods to an object whenever we feel like it, even while the program is running. Javascript is one example of it unlike Java where object is an instance of class.

In Class based OOP, class contains information about what every instance of that class has. It tells us which methods and properties are there and how we can use this class of things. The class itself doesn’t actually contain any data. That’s the job of an object.

Unlike inheritance in Java is done using classes, inheritance is done in Javascript using objects and it is called prototypal inheritance. 

Class based OOP provides a layer of abstraction in the form of class. PBP is flexible eand easy to work with but are more bug prone. Class based OOP is rigid and sturday, leading to fewer bugs.

## For vs While Loop : 

In an if statement inside For loop, if you want to stop execution after finding something use break;

While loop is used when we want to execute until some point and then stop.

## Modulo 

Modulo is the reminder after division.
For example : 5%10 = 5 (remainder)
10%10 = 0
